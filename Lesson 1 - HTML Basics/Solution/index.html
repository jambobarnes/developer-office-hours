            <p>With fossil records dating back 400 million years, sharks have outlived the dinosaurs and many other forms of
                life currently on earth. There are more than 1,000 species of sharks and rays, with new species discovered
                every year.
            </p>
            <p>These majestic top predators that are so essential to the natural order of marine ecosystems now face their
                most severe threat from overfishing. Many species are threatened with extinction, with some families of rays
                such as sawfishes in peril. While sharks and rays have been an irreplaceable resource for coastal
                communities in the developing world for centuries, this unique balance is in danger of being lost forever.
